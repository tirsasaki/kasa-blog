Admonitions are special callout blocks used to highlight important information in Markdown. They help make content more structured and visually engaging.

## Basic Admonitions

### Information
> [!info]
> This is an informational callout. Use it to highlight useful details.

```bash
> [!info]
> This is an informational callout. Use it to highlight useful details.
```

### Note
> [!note]
> Notes provide additional context or clarifications.

```bash
> [!note]
> Notes provide additional context or clarifications.
```

### Tip
> [!tip]
> Tips offer helpful advice or best practices.

```bash
> [!tip]
> Tips offer helpful advice or best practices.
```

## Foldable Callouts

You can create foldable callouts to hide or expand content when needed.

> [!faq]- What is an FAQ callout?
> This is a foldable FAQ callout. Click to expand and reveal the answer.

```bash
> [!faq]- What is an FAQ callout?
> This is a foldable FAQ callout. Click to expand and reveal the answer.
```

## Nested Callouts

Admonitions can be nested for better structuring of complex information.

> [!question] What should I do?
> > [!todo] Make a checklist
> > > [!example] Here is an example checklist for reference.

```bash
> [!question] What should I do?
> > [!todo] Make a checklist
> > > [!example] Here is an example checklist for reference.
```

## Supported Admonition Types

There are various types of callouts available:

> [!abstract]
> Use for summarizing key points.

> [!todo]
> A to-do list or pending tasks reminder.

> [!success]
> Indicates a successful operation or positive outcome.

> [!question]
> Used for raising questions or discussions.

> [!warning]
> Warns users about potential risks or issues.

> [!failure]
> Highlights a failure or an error situation.

> [!danger]
> Use for critical warnings or severe risks.

> [!bug]
> Reports a bug or issue.

> [!example]
> Provides an example or use case.

> [!quote]
> Displays a quoted text for emphasis.

```bash
> [!Abstract]
> Use for summarizing key points.
```

Similarly, you can use other types of admonitions by replacing `info` with the desired type, such as `warning`, `success`, or `bug`.

Using admonitions effectively can enhance readability and comprehension, making your Markdown documentation more structured and user-friendly.
